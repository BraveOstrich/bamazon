# bamazon

Bamazon is a Javascript, MySQL storefront app.

You are able to select the item you would like to purchase, then select the quantity. You will be given a total for the items, and can continue with purchases. If there is not enough of a product in inventory, you will be notified of that, and will need to choose a quantity that is available.

See the GIF below for a demonstration.
